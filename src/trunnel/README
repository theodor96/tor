This directory contains code for use with, and code made by, the
automatic code generation tool "Trunnel".

The .trunnel files are the inputs here; the .c and .h files are the outputs.
To regenerate the .c and .h files, run "scripts/codegen/run_trunnel.sh".

For the Trunnel source code, and more documentation about using Trunnel,
see https://gitweb.torproject.org/trunnel.git , especially
    https://gitweb.torproject.org/trunnel.git/tree/README
and https://gitweb.torproject.org/trunnel.git/tree/doc/trunnel.md
