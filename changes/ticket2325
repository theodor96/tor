  o Documentation:
    - Include a specific and (hopefully) accurate documentation of the torrc
      file's meta-format in doc/torrc_format.txt. This is mainly of
      interest to people writing programs to parse or generate torrc files.
      This document is not a commitment to long-term compatibility;
      some aspects of the current format are a bit ridiculous. 
      Closes ticket 2325.
