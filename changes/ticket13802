  o Minor features (testing):
    - Add general tracing instrumentation to Tor. For now, this subsystem is
      not being used by any part of the code, it is for future use or external
      testing that is not part of the upstream code base. Any tracing
      framework needs to be enabled at compile time. Closes #13802.
