  o Minor features (testing):
    - Add a general event-tracing instrumentation support to Tor.  This
      subsystem will enable developers and researchers to add fine-grained
      instrumentation to their Tor instances, for use when examining Tor
      network performance issues.  There are no trace events yet, and
      event-tracing is off by default unless enabled at compile time.
      Implements ticket 13802.
