  o Major bugfixes (exit policies):
    - Avoid disclosing exit outbound bind addresses, configured port bind
      addresses, and local interface addresses in relay descriptors by
      default under ExitPolicyRejectPrivate. Instead, only reject these
      (otherwise unlisted) addresses if ExitPolicyRejectLocalInterfaces is set.
      Fixes bug 18456; bugfix on 0.2.7.2-alpha. Patch by teor.
