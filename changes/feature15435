  o Minor features (pluggable Transports):
    - When launching managed pluggable transports, setup a valid open stdin
      in the child process that can be used to detect if tor has terminated.
      The "TOR_PT_EXIT_ON_STDIN_CLOSE" enviornment variable can be used by
      implementations to detect this new behavior. Resolves ticket 15435.
