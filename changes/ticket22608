  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Extract the code for handling newly-open channels into a separate
      function from the general code to handle channel state transitions.
      This change simplifies our callgraph, reducing the size of the largest
      strongly connected component by roughly a factor of two.
      Closes ticket 22608
