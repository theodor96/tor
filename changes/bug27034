  o Minor bugfixes (controller):
    - Consider all routerinfo errors other than "not a server"
      to be transient for the purpose of "GETINFO exit-policy/*"
      controller request. Print stacktrace in the unlikely case
      of failing to recompute routerinfo digest. Fixes bug 27034;
      bugfix on 0.3.4.1-alpha.
