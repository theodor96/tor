  o Minor features (hidden service):
    - Add the new options "HiddenServiceMaxStreams" and
      "HiddenServiceMaxStreamsCloseCircuit" to allow hidden services to limit
      the maximum number of simultaneous streams per circuit, and optionally
      tear down the circuit when the limit is exceeded. Part of ticket 16052.
