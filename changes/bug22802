  o Minor bugfixes (format strictness):
    - Restrict several data formats to decimal. Previously, the
      BuildTimeHistogram entries in the state file, the "bw=" entries in the
      bandwidth authority file, and process IDs passed to the
      __OwningControllerProcess option could all be specified in hex or octal
      as well as in decimal.  This was not an intentional feature.
      Fixes bug 22802; bugfixes on 0.2.2.1-alpha, 0.2.2.2-alpha, and
      0.2.2.28-beta.
