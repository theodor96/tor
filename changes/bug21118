  o Major bugfixes (client, guard, crash):
    - In circuit_get_global_origin_list(), return the actual list of
      origin circuits. The previous version of this code returned
      the list of all the circuits, and could have caused strange bugs,
      including possible crashes.  Fixes bug 21118; bugfix on 0.3.0.1-alpha.
