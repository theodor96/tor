  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Merge functions used for describing nodes and suppress the functions
      that do not allocate memory for the output buffer string.
    - NODE_DESC_BUF_LEN constant and format_node_description() function
      cannot be used externally from router.c module anymore.
    - Closes ticket 25432. Patch by valentecaio.
