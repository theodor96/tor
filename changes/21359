  o Testing
    - tortls tests now use an autoconf check to determine if OpenSSL
      structures are opaque, instead of an explicit version check.
      See ticket 21359.

  o Minor bugfixes (compilation)
    - Support building with recent LibreSSL code that uses opaque
      structures. Closes ticket 21359.
