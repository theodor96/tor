  o Minor fixes (relays):
    - Check that both the ORPort and DirPort (if present) are reachable
      before publishing a relay descriptor. Otherwise, relays publish a
      descriptor with DirPort 0 when the DirPort reachability test takes
      longer than the ORPort reachability test.
      Closes bug #18050. Reported by "starlight", patch by "teor".
      Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc, commit a1f1fa6ab on 27 Feb 2005.
