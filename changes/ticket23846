  o Minor features (build):
    - If you pass the "--enable-pic" option to configure, Tor will try to
      tell the compiler to build position-independent code suitable to
      link into a library. (The default remains -fPIE, for code suitable for a
      relocatable executable.) Closes ticket 23846.
