  o Major bugfixes (socket accounting):
    - In our socket accounting code, count a socket as closed even
      when it is closed indirectly by the TLS layer. Previously, we
      would count these sockets as still in use, and incorrectly believe that
      we had run out of sockets. Fixes bug 27795; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.
