  o Minor bugfixes (directory authority):
    - When parsing detached signature, make sure we use the length of the
      digest algorithm instead of an hardcoded DIGEST256_LEN in order to
      avoid comparing bytes out of bound with a smaller digest length such
      as SHA1. Fixes #19066; bugfix on tor-0.2.2.6-alpha.
