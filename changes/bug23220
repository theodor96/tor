  o Minor features (client directory bandwidth tuning):

    - When downloading (micro)descriptors, don't split the list of
      descriptors into multiple requests unless there are at least 32
      descriptors that we want. Previously, we split at 4, not 32, which
      could lead to significant overhead in HTTP request size and
      degradation in compression performance. Closes ticket 23220.
