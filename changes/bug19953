  o Minor bugfixes (relay)
    - Honor DataDirectoryGroupReadable when tor is a relay. Previously, the
      initialization of the keys would reset the DataDirectory to 0700 instead
      of 0750 if DataDirectoryGroupReadable was set to 1. Fixes #19953. Patch
      by "redfish".; bugfix on tor-0.0.2pre16.
