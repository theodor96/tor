  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service v3):
    - Don't log an assertion failure when we can't find the right information
      to extend to an introduction point. In rare cases, this could happen,
      causing a warning, even though tor would recover gracefully.
      Fixes bug 23159; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
