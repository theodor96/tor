  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service v2):
    - Demote a log warning to info in case we do not have a consensus when a
      .onion request comes in. This can happen while bootstrapping for
      instance. The request will follow through after so we really don't need
      to warn the user loudly. Fixes bug 27040; bugfix on 0.2.8.2-alpha.
