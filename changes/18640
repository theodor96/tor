  o Major features (resource management):
    - Tor now includes support for noticing when we are about to run out of
      sockets, and preemptively closing connections of lower priority.
      (This feature is off by default for now, since the current prioritizing
      method is not mature enough yet. You can enable it by setting
      "DisableOOSCheck 0".) Closes ticket 18640.
