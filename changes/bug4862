  o Major feature (Hidden Service):
    - Remove the introduction point adaptative algorithm which is leaking
      popularity by changing the amount of introduction points depending on
      the amount of traffic the HS sees. With this, we stick to only 3
      introduction points.
    - Add the torrc option HiddenServiceNumIntroductionPoints for an
      operatory to specify a fix amount of introduction points. Maximum
      value is 10 and default is 3.
