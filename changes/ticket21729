  o Minor features (logging):
    - Log files are no longer created world-readable by default.
      (Previously, most distributors would store the logs in a
      non-world-readable location to prevent inappropriate access. This
      change is an extra precaution.)  Closes ticket 21729; patch from
      toralf.
