  o Minor bugfixes (unit tests):
    - Fix shared random unit test that was failing on big endian architecture
      due to internal representation of a integer copied to a buffer. The test
      is changed to take a full 32 bytes of data and use the output of a
      python script that make the COMMIT and REVEAL calculation according to
      the spec.  Fixes bug 19977; bugfix on tor-0.2.9.1-alpha.
