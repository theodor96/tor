  o Minor bugfixes (client, reachableaddresses):
    - Instead of adding an "reject *:*" line to ReachableAddresses when
      loading the configuration, add one to the policy after parsing it
      in parse_reachable_addresses(). This prevents extra "reject *.*"
      lines from accumulating on reloads. Fixes bug 20874; bugfix on
      0.3.5.1-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
