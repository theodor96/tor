  o Removed features (hidden service, tor2web):
    - Remove Tor2web functionalities. The Tor2webMode and
      Tor2webRendezvousPoints options are now obsolete. Note that this feature
      was never shipped in vanilla Tor and it was only possible to use this
      feature by building the support at compile time. Closes ticket 26367.
