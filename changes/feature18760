  o Minor features (relay, usability):
    - When the directory authorities refuse a bad relay's descriptor,
      encourage the relay operator to contact us. Many relay operators
      won't notice this line in their logs, but it's a win if even a
      few learn why we don't like what their relay was doing. Resolves
      ticket 18760.
