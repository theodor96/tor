  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - The .may_include files that we use to describe our
      directory-by-directory dependency structure now describe a noncircular
      dependency graph over the directories that they cover.
      Our checkIncludes.py tool now enforces this.
      Closes ticket 28362.
