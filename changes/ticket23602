  o Minor bugfixes (build):
    - When searching for OpenSSL, don't accept any OpenSSL library that lacks
      TLSv1_1_method(): Tor doesn't build with those versions.  Additionally,
      look in /usr/local/opt/openssl, if it's present.  These changes
      together repair the default build on OSX systems with Homebrew
      installed. Fixes bug 23602; bugfix on 0.2.7.2-alpha.
