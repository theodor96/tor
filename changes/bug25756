  o Minor bugfixes (error reporting):
    - Improve tolerance for directory authorities with skewed clocks.
      Previously, an authority with a clock more than 60 seconds ahead
      could cause a client with a correct clock to warn that the
      client's clock was behind.  Now the clocks of a majority of
      directory authorities have to be ahead of the client before this
      warning will occur.  Fixes bug 25756; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.
