  o Minor features:
    - Recover better when our clock jumps back many hours, like might
      happen for Tails or Whonix users who start with a very wrong
      hardware clock, use Tor to discover a more accurate time, and then
      fix their clock. Resolves part of ticket 8766.
      [I'd call this a major feature if it actually fixed all of the issues.]
