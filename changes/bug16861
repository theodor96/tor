  o Major features (traffic analysis resistance):
   - Relays and clients will now send a padding cell on idle OR
     connections every 1.5 to 9.5 seconds (tunable via consensus
     parameters). Directory connections and inter-relay connections
     are not padded. Padding is negotiated using Tor's link protocol,
     so both relays and clients must upgrade for this to take effect.
     Clients may still send padding despite the relay's version by
     setting ConnectionPadding 1 in torrc, and may disable padding
     by setting ConnectionPadding 0 in torrc. Padding may be minimized
     for mobile users with the torrc option ReducedConnectionPadding.
     Implements Proposal 251 and Section 2 of Proposal 254; closes ticket
     16861.
   - Relays will publish 24 hour totals of padding and non-padding cell
     counts to their extra-info descriptors, unless PaddingStatistics 0
     is set in torrc. These 24 hour totals are also rounded to multiples
     of 10000.
