  o Minor bugfixes (test):
    - When testing workqueue event-cancellation, make sure that we actually
      cancel an event, and that cancel each event with equal probability.
      (It was previously possible, though extremely unlikely, for our
      event-canceling test not to cancel any events.) Fixes bug 26008;
      bugfix on 0.2.6.3-alpha.
