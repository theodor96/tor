  o Minor bugfixes (periodic events):
    - Refrain from calling routerlist_remove_old_routers() from
      check_descriptor_callback(). Instead, create a new periodic
      event that will run once every hour even if Tor is not configured
      as onion router. Fixes bug 27929; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha.
