  o Minor bugfixes (security, exit policies):
    - ExitPolicyRejectPrivate rejects more private addresses by default.
      Specifically, it rejects
      the relay's outbound bind addresses (if configured), and
      the relay's configured port addresses (such as ORPort and DirPort).
      Fixes bug 17027; bugfix on 0.2.0.11-alpha. Patch by "teor".
