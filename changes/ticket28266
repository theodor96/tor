  o Minor features (directory authority):
    - Directory authorities support a new consensus algorithm,
      under which microdescriptor entries are encoded in a canonical
      form. This improves their compressibility in transit and on the client.
      Closes ticket 28266; implements proposal 298.

  o Minor features (relay):
    - When listing relay families, list them in canonical form including the
      relay's own identity, and try to give a more useful set of warnings.
      Part of ticket 28266 and proposal 298.
