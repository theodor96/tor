  o Minor features:
    - Remove assertions during builds to determine Tor's test coverage.
      We don't want to trigger these even in assertions, so including
      them artificially makes our branch coverage look worse than it is.
      This patch provides the new test-stem-full and coverage-html-full
      configure options. Implements ticket 15400.
