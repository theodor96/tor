  o Minor bug fixes (option parsing):
    - Count unix sockets when counting client listeners (SOCKS, Trans,
      NATD, and DNS). This has no user-visible behaviour changes: these
      options are set once, and never read.
      Required for correct behaviour in ticket #17178.
      Fixes bug #19677, patch by teor.
