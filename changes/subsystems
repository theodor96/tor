  o Major features (refactoring):
    - Tor now uses an explicit list of its own subsystems when initializing
      and shutting down.  Previously, these systems were managed implicitly
      though various places throughout the codebase.  (There still some
      subsystems using the old system.)
      Closes ticket 28330.
