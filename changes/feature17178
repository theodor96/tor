  o Major features (onion services):
    - Add experimental OnionServiceSingleHopMode and
      OnionServiceNonAnonymousMode options. When both are set to 1, every
      hidden service on a tor instance becomes a non-anonymous Single Onion
      Service. Single Onions make one-hop (direct) connections to their
      introduction and renzedvous points. One-hop circuits make Single Onion
      servers easily locatable, but clients remain location-anonymous.
      This is compatible with the existing hidden service implementation, and
      works on the current tor network without any changes to older relays or
      clients.
      Implements proposal #260, completes ticket #17178. Patch by teor & asn.
  o Minor bug fixes (Tor2web):
    - Prevent Tor2web clients running hidden services, these services are
      not anonymous due to the one-hop client paths.
      Fixes bug #19678. Patch by teor.
