  o Major features (onion services):
    - Add experimental HiddenServiceSingleHopMode and
      HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode options. When both are set to 1, every
      hidden service on a tor instance becomes a non-anonymous Single Onion
      Service. Single Onions make one-hop (direct) connections to their
      introduction and renzedvous points. One-hop circuits make Single Onion
      servers easily locatable, but clients remain location-anonymous.
      This is compatible with the existing hidden service implementation, and
      works on the current tor network without any changes to older relays or
      clients.
      Implements proposal #260, completes ticket #17178. Patch by teor & asn.
  o Minor features (Tor2web):
    - Make Tor2web clients respect ReachableAddresses.
      This feature was inadvertently enabled in 0.2.8.6, then removed
      by bugfix #19973 on 0.2.8.7.
      Implements feature #20034. Patch by teor.
  o Minor bug fixes (Tor2web):
    - Prevent Tor2web clients running hidden services, these services are
      not anonymous due to the one-hop client paths.
      Fixes bug #19678. Patch by teor.
  o Minor bug fixes (circuits):
    - Use CircuitBuildTimeout whenever LearnCircuitBuildTimeout is disabled.
      Fixes bug #19678 in commit 5b0b51ca3 in 0.2.4.12-alpha. Patch by teor.
  o Minor bug fixes (options):
    - Stop changing the configured value of UseEntryGuards on authorities
      and Tor2web clients.
      Fixes bug #20074 in commits 51fc6799 in tor-0.1.1.16-rc and
      acda1735 in tor-0.2.4.3-alpha. Patch by teor.
    - Check the consistency of UseEntryGuards and EntryNodes more reliably.
      Fixes bug #20074 in commit 686aaa5c in tor-0.2.4.12-alpha. Patch by teor.
