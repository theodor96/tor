  o Minor bugfixes (rust, directory authority):
    - Fix an API mismatch in the rust implementation of
      protover_compute_vote(). This bug could have caused crashes on any
      directory authorities running Tor with Rust (which we do not yet
      recommend). Fixes bug 27741; bugfix on 0.3.3.6.
