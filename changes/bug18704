  o Major bugfixes (hidden service client)
    - With FetchHidServDescriptors set to 0, there is no descriptor fetch
      (which is intended) but also no descriptor cache lookup was done
      making any Tor client not working with this option unset. Resolves
      ticket #18704. Patch by "twim"; Bugfix on tor-0.2.0.20-rc.
