  o Minor feature (bootstrap):
    - When reporting bootstrap progress, stop distinguishing between
      situations where it seems that only internal paths are available
      and situations where it seems that external paths are available.
      Previously, tor would often erroneously report that it had only
      internal paths.  Closes ticket 27402.

  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Split out bootstrap progress reporting from control.c into a
      separate file.  Part of ticket 27402.
