  o Minor bugfixes (tests):
    - Use X509_new() to allocate certificates that will be freed later
      with X509_free(). Previously, some parts of the unit tests had
      used tor_malloc_zero(), which is incorrect, and which caused
      test failures on Windows when they were built with extra hardening.
      Fixes bugs 25943 and 25944; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha.
      Patch by Marcin Cie≈õlak.
