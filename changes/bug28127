  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - Unless we have explicitly set HiddenServiceVersion, detect the onion
      service version and then look for invalid options. Previously, we
      did the reverse, but that broke existing configs which were pointed
      to a v2 hidden service and had options like HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient
      set Fixes bug 28127; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
