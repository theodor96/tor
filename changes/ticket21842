  o Removed features:
    - We've removed the tor-checkkey tool from src/tools. Long ago, we
      used it to help people detect RSA keys that were generated by
      versions of Debian affected by CVE-2008-0166. But those keys
      have been out of circulation for ages, and this tool is no
      longer required.  Closes ticket 21842.
