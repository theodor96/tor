  o Minor bugfixes (circuit prediction):
    - Fix circuit_stream_is_being_handled so it correctly reports on circuits
      with isolation settings. Ports must not be said to be "handled" by
      already-isolated circuits, and a stream can only be handled by a circuit
      if their isolation settings are compatible. Fixes bug 18859.
