  o Minor bugfixes (bandwidth management):
    - Consider ourselves "low on write bandwidth" if we have exhausted our
      write bandwidth some time in the last second. This was the
      documented behavior before, but the actual behavior was to change
      this value every TokenBucketRefillInterval. Fixes bug 25828; bugfix on
      0.2.3.5-alpha.
