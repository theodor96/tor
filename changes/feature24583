  o Minor features (testing, debugging):
    - For development purposes, Tor now has a mode in which it runs
      for a few seconds, then stops, and starts again without exiting
      the process. This mode is meant to help us debug various issues
      with ticket 23847. To use this feature, compile with
      --enable-restart-degbugging, and set the TOR_DEBUG_RESTART
      environment variable. This is expected to crash a lot, and is
      really meant for developers only. It will likely be removed in a future
      release. Implements ticket 24583.
