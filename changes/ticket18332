  o Removed features:
    - Streamline relay-side hsdir handling: when relays consider whether
      to accept an uploaded hidden service descriptor, they no longer
      check whether they are one of the relays in the network that is
      "supposed" to handle that descriptor. Implements ticket 18332.
