  o Minor features (client):
    - Relax the validation done to hostnames in SOCKS5 requests, and allow
      a single trailing '.' to cope with clients that pass FQDNs using that
      syntax to explicitly indicate that the domain name is
      fully-qualified. Fixes bug 16674; bugfix on 0.2.6.2-alpha.
