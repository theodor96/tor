  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service v3):
    - When deleting an ephemeral onion service (DEL_ONION), do not close any
      rendezvous circuits in order to let the existing client connections
      finish by themselves or closed by the application. The HS v2 is doing
      that already so now we have the same behavior for all versions. Fixes
      bug 28619; bugfix on 0.3.3.1-alpha.
