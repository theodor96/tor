  o Minor bugfixes (client, usability):
    - Refrain from needlessly rejecting SOCKS5-with-hostnames and SOCKS4a
      requests that contain IP address strings, even when SafeSocks in
      enabled, as this prevents user from connecting to known IP addresses
      without relying on DNS for resolving. SafeSocks still rejects SOCKS
      connections that connect to IP addresses when those addresses are _not_
      encoded as hostnames. Fixes bug 22461, bugfix on Tor 0.2.6.2-alpha.
