  o Minor features (timekeeping, circuit scheduling):
    - When keeping track of how busy each circuit have been recently on
      a given connection, use coarse-grained monotonic timers rather than
      gettimeofday(). This change should marginally increase accuracy
      and performance.  Implements part of ticket 25927.
