  o Minor bugfixes (test networks)
    - When self-testing reachability, use ExtendAllowPrivateAddresses
      to determine if local/private addresses imply reachability.
      The previous fix used TestingTorNetwork, which implies
      ExtendAllowPrivateAddresses, but this excluded rare configs where
      ExtendAllowPrivateAddresses is set but TestingTorNetwork is not.
      Fixes bug 15771; bugfix on 0.2.6.1-alpha, bug #13924.
      Patch by "teor", issue discovered by CJ Ess.
