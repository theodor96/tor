  o Minor features (security, TLS):
    - Servers no longer support clients that do not provide AES
      ciphersuites. (3DES is no longer considered an acceptable
      cipher.) We believe that no such clients currently exist,
      since we have required OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later since 2009.
      Closes ticket 19998.
