  o Major features (Ed25519 identity keys: #12498, Prop220):
    - All relays now maintain a stronger identity key, using the
      Ed25519 elliptic curve signature format.  This master key is
      designed so that it can be kept offline. Relays also generate
      an online signing key, and a set of other Ed25519 keys and certificates.
      These are all automatically regenerated and rotated as needed.     
    - Directory authorities track which Ed25519 identity keys have been
      used with which RSA1024 identity keys, and do not allow them to vary
      freely.
    - Directory authorities now vote on Ed25519 identity keys along with
      RSA1024 keys.
    - Microdescriptors now include ed25519 identity keys.

  o Major features (onion key cross-certification):
    - Relay descriptors now include signatures of the identity keys using
      the TAP and ntor onion keys. This allows relays to prove ownership of
      their own onion keys. Because of this change, microdescriptors no longer
      need to include RSA identity keys. Implements proposal 228;
      closes ticket 12499.

  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - The link authentication code has been refactored for better testability
      and reliability.  It now uses code generated with the "trunnel"
      binary encoding generator, to reduce the risk of bugs due to 
      programmer error. Done as part of ticket 12498.

  o Testing:
    - The link authentication protocol code now has extensive tests.
    - The relay descriptor signature testing code now has extensive tests.
