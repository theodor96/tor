  o Minor bugfixes (correctness, controller):
    - Make the controller's write_escaped_data() function robust to extremely
      long inputs. Right now, it doesn't actually receive any extremely
      long inputs, so this is for defense in depth. Fixes bug 19281;
      bugfix on 0.1.1.1-alpha. Reported by Guido Vranken.
