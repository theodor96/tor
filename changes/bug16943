  o Major features (dirauths, security, hidden services):
    - Directory authorities can now perform the shared randomness protocol
      specified by proposal 250. Using this protocol, directory authorities can
      generate a global fresh random number every day. In the future, this
      global randomness will be used by hidden services to select their
      responsible HSDirs. This release only implements the directory authority
      feature; the hidden service side will be implemented in the future as
      part of proposal 224 . Resolves ticket #16943 and proposal 250.
