  o Minor features (fallback directory mirrors):
    - Accept relays that are a fuzzy match to a fallback whitelist entry.
      If a relay matches at least one fingerprint, IPv4 address, or IPv6
      address in the fallback whitelist, it can become a fallback. This
      reduces the work required to keep the list up to date.
      Closes ticket 24838.
