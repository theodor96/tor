  o Minor bugfixes
    - Disregard the ConnDirectionStatistics torrc options when Tor is
      not a relay since in that mode of operation no sensible data is
      being collected and because Tor might run into measurement hiccups
      when running as a client for some time, then becoming a relay. Fixes
      bug 15604; bugfix on 0.2.2.35.
