  o Minor bugfix (relays, hidden services):
    - Refuse connection requests to private OR addresses unless
      ExtendAllowPrivateAddresses is set. Previously, tor would
      connect, then refuse to send any cells to a private address.
      Fixes bugs 17674 and 8976; bugfix on 0.2.3.21-rc.
      Patch by "teor".
