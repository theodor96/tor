  o Major bugfixes (hidden services):
    - Clients require hidden services to include the TAP keys
      for their intro points in the hidden service descriptor.
      This prevents an inadvertent upgrade to ntor, which a
      malicious hidden service could use to discover which
      consensus a client has.
      Fixes bug 20012; bugfix on 0.2.4.8-alpha. Patch by teor.
