  o Minor features (crypto):
    - Fix a segfault during startup:  If unix socket was configured as
      listener (such as a ControlSocket or a SocksPort unix socket), and
      tor was started as root but not configured to switch to another
      user, tor would segfault while trying to string compare a NULL
      value.  Fixes bug 18261; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha. Patch by weasel.
