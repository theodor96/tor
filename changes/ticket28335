  o Major features (client):
    - When Tor is running as a client, and it is unused for a long time, it
      can now enter a "dormant" state.  When Tor is dormant, it avoids
      network activity and CPU wakeups until it is reawoken either by a user
      request or by a controller command.  For more information, see
      the configuration options starting with "Dormant". Implements tickets
      2149 and 28335.
