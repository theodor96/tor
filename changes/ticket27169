  o Minor features (bootstrap):
    - Improve user experience by deferring directory progress
      reporting until after a connection to a relay or bridge has
      succeeded.  This avoids reporting 80% progress based on cached
      directory information when we can't even connect to a bridge or
      relay.  Closes ticket 27169.
