  o Removed features:
    - The old "round-robin" circuit multiplexer (circuitmux)
      implementation has been removed, along with a fairly large set of
      code that existed to support it.  It has not been the default
      circuitmux since we introduced the "EWMA" circuitmux in 0.2.4.x,
      but it still required an unreasonable amount of memory and CPU.
      Closes ticket 25268.
