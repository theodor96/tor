  o Minor bugfixes (connection, relay):
    - Avoid a wrong BUG() stacktrace in case a closing connection is being held
      open because the write side is rate limited but not the read side. Now,
      the connection read side is simply shutdown instead of kept open until tor
      is able to flush the connection and then fully close it. Fixes bug 27750;
      bugfix on 0.3.4.1-alpha.
