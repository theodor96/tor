  o Minor features (infrastructure):
    - Tor now includes an improved timer backend, so that we can efficiently
      support tens or hundreds of thousands of concurrent timers, as will be
      needed for some of our planned anti-traffic-analysis work. This code
      is based on William Ahern's "timeout.c" project, which implements
      a "tickless hierarchical timing wheel". Closes ticket 18365.
