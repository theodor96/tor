  o Minor features (testing):
    - Add a "--disable-memory-sentinels" feature to help with fuzzing.
      When Tor is compiled with this option, we disable a number of
      redundant memory-safety failsafes that are intended to stop
      bugs from becoming security issues. This makes it easier to hunt
      for bugs that would be security issues without the failsafes
      turned on. Closes ticket 21439.
