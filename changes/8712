  o Minor features (directory authorities):
    - Directory authorities no longer vote against the "Fast",
      "Stable", and "HSDir" flags just because they were going to vote
      against "Running": if the consensus turns out to be that the
      router was running, then the authority's vote should count.
      Patch from Peter Retzlaff; closes issue 8712.
