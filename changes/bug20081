  o Minor bugfixes (allocation):
    - Change how we allocate memory for large chunks on buffers, to avoid
      a (currently impossible) integer overflow, and to waste less space
      when allocating unusually large chunks. Fixes bug 20081; bugfix on
      0.2.0.16-alpha. Issue identified by Guido Vranken.
