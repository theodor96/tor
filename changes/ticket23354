  o Minor features (configuration):
    - The "DownloadSchedule" options have been renamed to end with
      "DownloadInitialDelay".  The old names are still allowed, but will
      produce a warning. Comma-separated lists are still permitted for
      these options, but all values after the first are ignored (as they have
      been since 0.2.9). Closes ticket 23354.
