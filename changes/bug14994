  o Minor bugfixes (command-line interface):
    - When "--quiet" is provided along with "--validate-config", do not
      write anything to stdout on success. Fixes bug 14994; bugfix on
      0.2.3.3-alpha.
    - When complaining about bad arguments to "--dump-config", use
      stderr, not stdout.
