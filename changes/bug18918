  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - In order to make the OR and dir checking function in router.c less
      confusing we renamed some functions and consider_testing_reachability()
      has been splitted into router_should_check_reachability() and
      router_do_reachability_checks(). Also we improved the documentation in
      some functions. Closes ticket 18918.
