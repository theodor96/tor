  o Minor features (integration, hardening):
    - Added a new NoExec option to . When this option is set to 1,
      Tor will never try to run another program, regardless of
      the settings of PortForwardingHelper, ClientTransportPlugin,
      or ServerTransportPlugin. Once NoExec is set, it cannot be
      disabled without restarting Tor.
      Closes ticket 22976.
