  o Minor bugfix (control protocol):
    - The reply to a "GETINFO config/names" request via the control protocol
      now spells the type "Dependent" correctly.  This is a breaking change in
      the control protocol.  (It seems to be ignored by the most common known
      clients.)  Fixes bug 18146; bugfix on 0.1.1.4-alpha.
