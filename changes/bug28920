  o Minor bugfixes (logging):
    - Rework rep_hist_log_link_protocol_counts() to iterate through all link
      protocol versions when logging incoming/outgoing connection counts. Tor
      no longer skips version 5 and we don't have to remember to update this
      function when new link protocol version is developed. Fixes bug 28920;
      bugfix on 0.2.6.10.
