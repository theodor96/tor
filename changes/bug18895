  o Minor features (build):
    - When building on a system without runtime support for some of the
      runtime hardening options, try to log a useful warning at configuration
      time, rather than an incomprehensible warning at link time.
      If expensive hardening was requested, this warning becomes an error.
      Closes ticket 18895.
