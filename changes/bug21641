  o Minor feature (defaults, directory):
    - Onion key rotation and expiry intervals are now defined as a network
      consensus parameter as per proposal 274. The default lifetime of an
      onion key is bumped from 7 to 28 days. Old onion keys will expire after 7
      days by default. Closes ticket 21641.
