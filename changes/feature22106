  o Major features (security, stability, experimental):

    - Tor now has the optional ability to include modules written in
      Rust.  To turn this on, pass the "--enable-rust" flag to the
      configure script.

      It's not time to get excited yet: currently, there is no actual
      Rust functionality beyond some simple glue code, and a notice at
      startup to tell you that Rust is running. Still, we hope that
      programmers and packagers will try building with rust
      support, so that we can find issues with the build system,
      and solve portability issues. Closes ticket 22106.
