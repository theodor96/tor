  o Minor bugfixes (directory authorities):
    - Die with a useful error when the operator forgets to place the
      authority_signing_key file into the keys directory. This avoids an
      uninformative assert & traceback about having an invalid key.
      Fixes bug 20065; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
