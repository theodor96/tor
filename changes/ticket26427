  o Minor features (code layout):
    - Make a new lowest-level error-handling API for use by code invoked
      from within the logging module.  This interface it makes it so
      the logging code is no longer at risk of calling into itself if
      a failure occurs while trying to log something.
      Closes ticket 26427.
