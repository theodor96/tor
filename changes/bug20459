  o Major bugfixes (scheduler):
    - Fix an issue where the ewma_cmp_cmux() function would never consider
      circuit policies to be different.  This bug caused the channel scheduler
      to behave more or less randomly, rather than preferring channels with
      higher-priority circuits.
      Fixes bug 20459; bugfix on 0.2.6.2-alpha.
