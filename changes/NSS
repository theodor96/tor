  o Major features (portability, cryptography, experimental, TLS):
    - Tor now has the option to compile with the NSS library instead of
      OpenSSL. This feature is experimental, and we expect that bugs may
      remain. It is mainly intended for environments where Tor's performance
      is not CPU-bound, and where NSS is already known to be installed.
      To try it out, configure Tor with the --enable-nss flag.
      Closes ticket 26631.
