  o Major bugfixes (scheduler):
    If a channel is put into the scheduler's pending list, then it starts
    closing, and then if the scheduler runs before it finishes closing, the
    scheduler will get stuck trying to flush its cells while the lower layers
    refuse to cooperate. Fix that race condition by given the scheduler an
    escape method. Fixes bug 23676; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha
