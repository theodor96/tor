  o Minor bugfixes (consensus weight):
    - Add new consensus method that initializes bw weights to 1 instead of 0. This
      prevents a zero weight from making it all the way to the end (happens in
      small testing networks) and causing an error. Fixes bug 14881.

  o Minor features (unit tests):
    - Add test for networkstatus_compute_bw_weights_v10
