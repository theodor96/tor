  o Minor bugfixes (compilation):

    - Stop trying to build with Clang 4.0's -Wthread-safety
      warnings. They apparently require a set of annotations that we
      aren't currently using, and they create false positives in our
      pthreads wrappers. Fixes bug 20110; bugfix on 0.2.9.1-alpha.
