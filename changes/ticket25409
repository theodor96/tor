  o Code simplification and refactoring:
      We remove the PortForwsrding and PortForwardingHelper options, related
      functions, and the port_forwarding tests. These options were used by
      the now-deprecated Vidalia to help ordinary users become Tor relays or
      bridges. Closes ticket 25409. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
