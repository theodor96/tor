  o Minor features:
    - Since some operating systems do not consider the actual modes on a
      UNIX domain socket itself, tor does not allow creating such a
      socket in a directory that is group or world accessible if it is
      supposed to be private.  Likewise, it will not allow only group
      accessible sockets in a world accessible directory.
      However, on some operating systems this is unnecessary, so
      add a per-socket option called RelaxDirModeCheck.
      Fixes bug 18458.  Patch by weasel.
