  o Minor fixes (bridge client bootstrap):
    - Make bridge clients with no running bridges try to download
      bridge descriptors immediately. But when bridge clients have
      running bridges, make them wait at least 3 hours before
      refreshing recently received bridge descriptors.
      Download schedules used to start with an implicit 0, but the
      fix for 17750 changed this undocumented behaviour, and made
      bridge clients hang for 15 minutes before bootstrapping.
      Fixes bug 23347, not in any released version of Tor.
