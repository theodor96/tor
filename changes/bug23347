  o Minor bug fixes (bridge client bootstrap):
    - Make bridge clients download bridge descriptors immediately.
      The bridge schedules were never correct, but we didn't realise until
      the fix for 17750 made bridge clients hang for 15 minutes before
      bootstrapping.
      Fixes bug 23347. Not in any released version of Tor.
