  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Directory servers now include a "Date:" http header for response
      codes other than 200. Clients starting with a skewed clock and a
      recent consensus were getting "304 Not modified" responses from
      directory authorities, so without a Date header the client would
      never hear about a wrong clock. Fixes bug 23499; bugfix on 0.0.8rc1.
