  o Minor bugfixes (relay):
    - If we are a relay where ExitRelay is auto and we have not specified
      an exit policy, whether through ExitPolicy lines or ReducedExitPolicy,
      emulate the behavior of ExitRelay as 0. Previously, we allowed exit
      traffic if ExitRelay is auto and logged a warning message. Fixes bug
      21530; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
