  o Minor Features (crypto, testing):
    - Now that OpenSSL has its own scrypt implementation, add an unit
      test that checks for interoperability between libscrypt_scrypt()
      and OpenSSL's EVP_PBE_scrypt() so that we could not use libscrypt
      and rely on EVP_PBE_scrypt() whenever possible. Resolves ticket
      16189.
