  o Minor bugfixes (relay statistics):
    - When a relay is collecting internal statistics about how many
      create cell requests it has seen of each type, accurately count the
      requests from relays that temporarily fall out of the consensus. (To
      be extra conservative, we were already ignoring requests from
      clients in our counts, and we continue ignoring them here.) Fixes
      bug 24910; bugfix on 0.2.4.17-rc.
