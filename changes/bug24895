  o Major bugfixes (onion services):
    - Fix an "off by 2" error in counting rendezvous failures on the
      onion service side. While we thought we would stop the rendezvous
      attempt after one failed circuit, we were actually making three
      circuit attempts before giving up. Fixes bug 24895; bugfix on 0.0.6.
