  o Major bugfixes (open file limit):
    - The max open file limit wasn't checked before calling
      tor_accept_socket_nonblocking() which made tor go beyond the open
      file limit set previously. With this fix, before opening a new socket,
      tor validates the open file limit just before and if the max has been
      reached, return EMFILE.; Fixes #16288; bugfix on tor-0.1.1.1-alpha~74.
