  o Minor bugfixes (tests):
    - Change the behavior of the "channel/outbound" test so that it never
      causes a 10-second rollover for the EWMA circuitmux code. Previously,
      this behavior would happen randomly, and result in fluctuating test
      coverage. Fixes bug 25994; bugfix on 0.3.3.1-alpha.
