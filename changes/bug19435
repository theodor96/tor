  o Major bugfixes (user interface):
    - Fix an integer overflow in the rate-limiter that caused displaying of
      wrong number of suppressed messages (if there are too many of them).
      If the number of messages hits the limit of messages per interval the
      rate-limiter drops a warning and doesn't count any further.
      Fixes bug 19435.
