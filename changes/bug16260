  o Minor bugfix (Hidden service)
    - When cannibalizing a circuit for an introduction point, always extend
      to the chosen exit node creating a 4 hop circuit instead of using the
      current circuit exit node which resulted in changing the original
      intro point choice. This resulted in the hidden service skipping
      excluded nodes like for instance reconnecting to an expired intro
      point.; Fixes #16260; bugfixes on tor-0.1.0.1-rc~460.

      This is particularly important for the introduction point retry
      behavior (#8239) since cannibalization is allowed, which is desired,
      so it's important to pin the chosen exit point.
