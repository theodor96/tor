  o Minor features (compression, zstd):
    - When running with zstd, Tor now considers using advanced functions that
      the zstd maintainers have labeled as potentially unstable. To
      prevent breakage, Tor will only use this functionality when
      the runtime version of the zstd library matches the version
      with which it were compiled.  Closes ticket 25162.
