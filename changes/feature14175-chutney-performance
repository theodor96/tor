  o Major enhancements (performance testing):
    - Add chutney performance testing support to src/test/test-network.sh
      The following arguments change how chutney verifies the network:
      --bytes n             sends n bytes per test connection (10 KBytes)
      --connections n       makes n test connections per client (1)
      --hs-multi-client 1   makes each client connect to each HS (0)
      Requires the corresponding chutney performance testing changes.
      Note: using --connections 7 or greater on a HS will trigger #15937.
      Patch by "teor".
