  o Major enhancements (performance testing):
    - Add chutney performance testing support to src/test/test-network.sh
      The following arguments change how chutney verifies the network:
      "--bytes n" sends n bytes per test connection;
      "--connections n" makes n test connections per client; and
      "--hs-multi-client 1" makes each client connect to each HS.
      Requires the corresponding chutney performance testing changes.
      Note: using --connections 7 or greater on a HS will trigger issue 15937.
      Patch by "teor". Closes ticket 14175.
