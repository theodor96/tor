  o Minor feature (testing, ipv6):
    - Add the hs-ipv6 chutney target to make test-network-all's IPv6
      tests. Remove bridges+hs, as it's somewhat redundant.
      This requires a recent chutney version that supports IPv6 clients,
      relays, and authorities.
      Closes ticket 20069; patch by teor.
