  o Minor enhancements (correctness, testing):
    - Document use of coverity, clang static analyzer, and clang dynamic
      undefined behavior and address sanitizers in doc/HACKING.
      Add clang dynamic sanitizer blacklist in
      contrib/clang/sanitizer_blacklist.txt to exempt known undefined
      behavior. Include detailed usage instructions in the blacklist.
      Patch by "teor".
