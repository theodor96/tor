  o Major features (embedding):
    - Tor now has support for restarting in the same process.
      Controllers that run Tor using the "tor_api.h" interface can now
      restart Tor after Tor has exited. This support is incomplete, however:
      we have fixed the crash bugs that prevented it from working at all
      before, but many bugs probably remain, including the possibility of
      security issues. Implements ticket 24581.
