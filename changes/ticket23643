  o Minor features (compilation, testing):
    - Tor builds should now fail if there are any mismatches between the C
      type representing a configuration variable and the C type the
      data-driven parser uses to store a value there.  Previously, we needed
      to check these by hand, which sometimes led to mistakes. Closes ticket
      23643.
