  o Minor bugfix (hidden service v3, client):
    - Avoid a BUG() stacktrace in case a SOCKS connection is found waiting for
      the descriptor while we do have it in the cache. There is a rare case
      when this can happen. Now, tor will recover and retry the descriptor.
      Fixes bug 28669; bugfix on 0.3.2.4-alpha.
