  o Minor features (unix permissions):
    - Defer creation of Unix sockets until after setuid. This avoids needing
      CAP_CHOWN and CAP_FOWNER when using systemd's CapabilityBoundingSet, or
      chown and fowner when using SELinux.
      Implements part of ticket 17562. Patch from Jamie Nguyen.
