  o Major bugfixes:
    - Relays that set MyFamily no longer free the elements of
      options->MyFamily while making their descriptor. They tried to
      access the freed elements, and then double-free them, when making
      the next descriptor or when changing the config. Fixes bug 22368;
      bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
