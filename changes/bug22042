  o Minor bugfixes (control, hidden service client):
    - Trigger HS descriptor events on the control port when the client is
      unable to pick a suitable hidden service directory. This can happen if
      they are all in the ExcludeNodes list or they all have been queried
      inside the allowed 15 minutes. Fixes bug 22042; bugfix on
      0.2.5.2-alpha.
