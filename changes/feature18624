  o Minor features:
    - Directory authorities now only give the Guard flag to a relay if
      they are also giving it the Stable flag. This change allows us to
      simplify path selection for clients, and it should have minimal
      effect in practice since >99% of Guards already have the Stable
      flag. Implements ticket 18624.
