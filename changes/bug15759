  o Minor bugfixes (testing):
    - Set the severity correctly when testing get_interface_addresses_ifaddrs()
      and get_interface_addresses_win32(), so that the tests fail gracefully
      instead of triggering an assertion. Fixes bug 15759; bugfix on
      0.2.6.3-alpha. Reported by Nicolas Derive.
