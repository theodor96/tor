  o Minor feature (include on config files):
    - Allow the use of %include on configuration files to include settings
      from other files or directories. Using %include with a directory will
      include all (non-dot) files in that directory in lexically sorted order
      (non-recursive), closes ticket 1922.
    - Makes SAVECONF command return error when overwriting a torrc
      that has includes. Using SAVECONF with the FORCE option will
      allow it to overwrite torrc even if includes are used, closes ticket
      1922.
    - Adds config-can-saveconf to GETINFO command to tell if SAVECONF
      will work without the FORCE option, closes ticket 1922.
