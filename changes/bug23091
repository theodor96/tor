  o Minor bugfixes (consensus expiry):
    - Tor would reconsider updating its directory information every 2 minutes
      instead of only doing it for a consensus that is more than 24 hours old
      (badly expired). This specific check is done in the tor main loop
      callback that validates if we have an expired consensus. Fixes bug
      23091; bugfix on 0.2.0.19-alpha.
