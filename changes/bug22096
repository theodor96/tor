  o Minor features (linux seccomp2 sandbox):
    - Increase the maximum allowed size passed to mprotect(PROT_WRITE)
      from 1MB to 16MB. This was necessary with the glibc allocator in
      order to allow worker threads to allocate more memory -- which in
      turn is necessary because of our new use of worker threads for
      compression. Closes ticket 22096.
