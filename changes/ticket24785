  o Minor features (fallbacks):
    - Avoid selecting fallbacks that change their IP addresses too often.
      Select more fallbacks by ignoring the Guard flag, and allowing lower
      cutoffs for the Running and V2Dir flags. Also allow a lower bandwidth,
      and a higher number of fallbacks per operator (5% of the list).
      Implements ticket 24785.
