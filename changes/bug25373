  o Major features (main loop, CPU wakeup):
    - The bandwidth-limitation logic has been refactored so that
      bandwidth calculations are performed on-demand, rather than
      every TokenBucketRefillInterval milliseconds.
      This change should improve the granularity of our bandwidth
      calculations, and limit the number of times that the Tor process needs
      to wake up when it is idle. Closes ticket 25373.
