  o Minor fixes (threads, comments):
    - Silence unused variable warnings in find_cipher_by_id
      Unused variable warnings were still generated under some versions
      of OpenSSL. Instead, make sure all variables are used under all
      versions of OpenSSL.
      Patch by "teor".
      Fix on 496df21c89d1, not in any released version of tor.
