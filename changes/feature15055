  o Major features (protocol, Ed25519):
    - Tor relays now use Ed25519 to prove their Ed25519 identities and
      Ed25519 to one another, and to clients. This algorithm is faster
      and more secure than the RSA-based handshake we've been doing until
      now. Implements the second big part of proposal 220; Closes ticket
      15055.
